## Implementation spec (15%)

> We asked for "a summary of your approach to implementing the server (and client, for teams of 4) and any modules, providing the prototype and brief description of each function, and specifics of the data structure(s) you plan to use."
> The "implementation spec should describe all of your implementation's units (other than those we provide), provide pseudo code for each unit's functions (including prototypes and their parameters), and describe every major data structure."

> We're looking for a clear, modular structure with well-chosen data structures, function names, and function interfaces.

TOTAL 30/30 points, as follows.

**Teams of 3 students:**

overall very good; see embedded comments.
be a little more careful with naming functions and variables.

  * (6/6) module structure, cohesion, coupling
  * (8/8) function prototypes (server)
  * (8/8) function descriptions & pseudocode(server)
  * (8/8) data structures (server)

## Division of labor

> We offered to re-visit the grade for "division of labor"

From your design review:

* (1/4) Plan for division of the work.

Based on new information:

* (4/4) much better.
* but Amittai is only testing? no coding of the game itself?
